## How to Use

### In your code:

```dart
import 'package:maypole/l10n/generated/app_localizations.dart';

// In widget build method:
final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;
Text(l10n.signIn)  // Simple string
Text(l10n.welcome('John'))  // String with parameter
```

### To add new strings:

1. Add to `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`
2. Add translation to `lib/l10n/app_es.arb`
3. Run `flutter gen-l10n` (or just run the app)

### To add a new language:

1. Create `lib/l10n/app_XX.arb` (where XX is language code)
2. Copy structure from `app_en.arb` and translate
3. Run `flutter gen-l10n`

## Files Structure

```
maypole-flutter/
├── l10n.yaml                          # Configuration
├── lib/
│   └── l10n/
│       ├── app_en.arb                 # English (template)
│       ├── app_es.arb                 # Spanish
│       └── generated/                 # Auto-generated (don't edit)

│           └── app_localizations_es.dart
└── LOCALIZATION.md                    # Documentation
```

## Notes

- The localization files in `lib/l10n/generated/` are automatically generated - don't edit them
  manually
- The app will automatically detect the device's language and use the appropriate translations
- If a translation is missing, it falls back to English
- All strings use the proper ARB format with descriptions for translators

## Verification

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# Check for errors
flutter analyze

# Generate localization files
flutter gen-l10n

# Run the app
flutter run
```

The app should now display in English or Spanish based on your device's language settings!
